We created an easy-to-use system to detect the credibility of a user’s claim or article, based on the concept of stance detection. The goal of this project is to identify whether given headline-article pairs: (1) agree, (2) disagree, (3) discuss the same topic, or (4) are not related at all. A machine learning model in Tensorflow that’s based off of several research papers in the field of stance detection is built. Our model uses a combination of  Bag-of-Words, Google’s word-2-vec, TF, TF-IDF (Term Frequency, Inverse Document Frequency), and ‘stopwords’ inside Scikit-learn to vectorize our input. That is run through a neural network single hidden layer with ReLU activation, a fully connected layer and a softmax activation function to produce one of 4 outputs.
